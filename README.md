# App intro

Before you start wiping the glass, make sure your camera permission is turned on.

Just simply by moving your hands up and down/left and right, you can wipe the 'dirty glass' on the screen.

When 40-50% of the screen is wiped, you can get a random Christmas tree card for wishes.

It's a good way to have fun and take a break.

Invite your friends to begin your wiping project and see what surprise you'll find!
